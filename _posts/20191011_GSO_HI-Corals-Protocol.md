### The How to Guide to Take Care of the Corals at GSO

Maintenance and Upkeep

1) Tanks Themselves 

	- When first arrive take notice of physical appearance of the water/tanks and corals. If notice anything weird (ascending/spreading dead patches/cloudiness of water) make note and treat as soon as possible.
		- For example when I noticed rapid tissue loss occurring in the Montipora fragments I clipped them well above the line of tissue loss, reglued them to new plugs, swapped out the current grate/rack they were on and drained the entire tank. 
			- The pumps and heaters were removed and left to dry while the grates, dead skeletons, and plugs were all bleach washed.
		- For cloudiness of water, I installed a second pump and let the tanks free flow on high for half an hour to an hour on an empty reservoir
		- Make sure to check that the drippers are still on and the tank is not input is not free flowing - it will overwhelm the reservoir in a matter of hours and cause flooding!
			- Drippers are set up (Red Point Out) to fill at the rate of 1/2 Gallon per hour.
				- If you take off the Dripper to let the tank free flow/flush there is a small bit of blue tubing that is on the dripper to make it fit into the inflow tubing.
					- This system works best when the tubing isn't pushed all the way up against the 
			- The input valves should always be turned half way on the entire time (last time I had the valve fully open for the drippers they fell off and everything flooded over the weekend)
		- When the conditions of tanks and corals are taken care of CHECK ON THE RESERVOIR! (See more on this below)
	
	- If everything looks good first take measurements (right now that is Temp, Salinity, and Light Intensity).
		- Temp is taken with the temperature probe in the blue case and between each tank is rinsed off with freshwater and dried
		- Salinity is taken with the aquarium hydrometer to get general sense of salinity (between 30-32 consistently). 
			- Dip it in the water, let it fill completely, flick the front face of it to get off any bubbles from the arm, and set it down on a flat surface to let it equilibrate
		- PAR is taken by hovering the sensor, face up over the racks at three different positions (I got straight across the middle and do a far left, middle and far right measurement)
			- Since Tank 13 is still out of commission take PAR measurements for both the rack in the back (originally the Tank 14 rack) and the one in the front (originally the Tank 13 rack)

	- Then clean the sides and bottoms of the tanks as best as you can with the squeegee (located on the right hand side of tank 14). 
	
	- May have to adjust the heaters or pumps if they have shifted during the week (if they are blowing over the fragments you need to move them and reset the plugs to face upright)
		- I installed two pumps in each tank to increase water flow to try to reduce stagnation - the water can get very cloudy if not constantly circulating
				- I like to have one pump on the bottom blowing at the rack but below the fragments and one on the same wall opposite side of the rack and up high to get everything mixing
				
	- After cleaning the walls of the tank make sure to brush clean the bases of the coral plugs, brush clean the tops of the racks themselves, and check on the spat plugs (at least once a week).
		- Will need to clean at least once a week to prevent complete smothering of algae. 
		- It is important to note that I clean these by picking algae off by hand (DO NOT USE THE TOOTHBRUSHES!!)
			- Feel free to use the microscope and light to look at them close up! The microscope is VERY HEAVY (> 50lbs)!
			- You can usually seem them with the naked eye BUT some spat has not become very pigmented (especially the MCAP) which makes them hard to find at times so be very careful cleaning them! 
			- Also a lot of the P acuta spat have settled on the side of the plugs so be careful about picking them up! 
		- If you feel that any of the tanks look gross you can do a water change/spot clean when feels necessary 
			- Should be less necessary with drippers constantly running but still good to keep an eye on it.
	
	- Make sure to keep a good record of notes each time you go (Conditions of corals/tanks, Measurements, Reservoir Treatments, etc.)
		- Update the Google Sheet of measurements (Shared Drive "Putnam Lab -> HI_Corals)
	
	- If you feel like it take photos and upload them to google drive (shared drive "Putnam Lab -> HI Corals -> Photos -> New Folder as the Date of Photos - Separate them out by tank)
	
2) Dealing with the Reservoir 

	- Most important things to know/remember 
		- The reservoir never fully flushes (always ~10 Gallons at the bottom ; where the outflow valve is located doesn't allow it to fully drain)
		- The reservoir is 110 Gallons 
		- All effluent NEEDS to be treated with the following
			- **1-10% Bleach 
				- I have settled on 2% aka two gallons of bleach which is two bottles.
			- **Sodium Thiosulfate Treatments
				- For every 120mL, 0.1mL of 10% Sodium Thiosulfate is needed
					- This has been worked out to about 0.083% of total volume (in mL which is then converted to gallons)
						- **IN SUMMARY for every 100 gallons of effluent treat with ~300mL of 10% Sodium Thiosulfate 
						- Mix well using the pump down (stir and pump to get water moving)
							- Ed said that 10 mins of contact time is sufficient but I like to leave it over night. 
				- 10% Sodium Thiosulfate Batches made and kept down at GSO 
					- If need to make more bring bottles back to lab (Sodium Thiosulfate is stored next to the Instant Ocean) 
					- 100 grams in 1 litre (1000mL) of DI Water 

	- There is currently a folder with data sheets and a pen down at the reservoir, EVERY TIME you do anything with the reservoir (Bleach Treat, Sodium ThioSulfate Treat, or Flush) MAKE NOTE OF IT
		- Record the date, time, action taken, volume of action done, initial, any notes if needed (you will see a record of my notes in the past - should be pretty straight forward

	- My routine with this has been 
		- Monday Morning: 
			- Flush Reservoir(takes about 30 minutes when full) 
			- Record Flush in binder on reservoir 
			- Stop water flow to tanks, complete measurements/tank maintenance in meantime
			- Close off valve of reservoir, add 2 bottles/gallons of bleach to reservoir
			- Record action in binder
			- Restore flow and watch drippers for a couple of minutes 
			
		- Wednesday Morning:
			- Check reservoir volume
			- Based on volume I decide to Sodium Thiosulfate treat it then or Thursday and flush it the next day after treatment(If around 60 gallons you can wait until Friday, if around 80 should flush it Thursday)
				- Have been able to get four days or five days out of reservoir
			- Record action taken in binder
			- Check tanks (no measurements required)
			
		- Thursday:
			- Treat or Flush depending on Wednesday decision
			- Record action taken in binder
			- See Monday for subsequent actions if flushed
			
		- Friday
			- Only if haven't flushed come in 
			- Record action taken in binder
			- See Monday for subsequent actions if flushed
