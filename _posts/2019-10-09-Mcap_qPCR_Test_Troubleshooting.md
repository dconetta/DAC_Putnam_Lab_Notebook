### qPCR of Master's Thesis Mcap Color Morphs and Subsequent Troubleshooting

_Resuspension_ *Completed on 20191003*

Goal here is to make stock suspensions for the qPCR C and D Actin Primers and Probes - Run DNA through Qubit to make sure have enough

IDTDNA Resuspension Instructions

	1)Centrifuge lyopholized primers for 2 mins at 12,000 RCF
	2) Add TE Buffer (modulated pH unlike H2O)
		- Recommended to be no less than 1uM and no greater than 10mM
		- Standard is 100uM 
		
			-25nmol ordered = 250uL of TE gets you to 100uM
				- Used Low TE -> 0.1mM EDTA vs 1 mM of EDTA in stock TE Buffer 
				
0.5uL of Forward Primers 100uM required in 1000uL diluted aliquots to get 50nM

	- 999.5uL of Ultra Pure H2O
	- 0.5uL of 100uM Forward Primers
	
0.75uL of Reverse Primers 100uM required in 1000uL diluted aliquots to get 75nM

	- 999.25uL of Ultra Pure H2O
	- 0.75uL of 100uM Forward Primers
	
1uL of Forward Primers 100uM required in 1000uL diluted aliquots to get 50nM

	- 999uL of Ultra Pure H2O
	- 1 uL of 100uM Forward Primers

*qPCR Machine Operation*

1) Open Program on qPCR computer (it is in the middle of the desktop - forgot what it is called)

2) Log-in	
	- Username: Putnam Lab
	- Roche480
	
3) Open Template
	- Created a template called "SymC_D_Multiplex" 
	- This template is created from Ross Cunning's 2016 Excess Algal Symbiont Paper (MEPS Paper)
		a) Pre Incubation
			- 50C for 2 mins
			- 95C for 10 mins
		b) PCR 
			- 45 Cycles of (Ross's was 40 Cycles but we did an extra five just incase - you can stop it when the fluorescence levels off with "Stop Run" NOT ABORT, ABORT gets you no data!)
				- 95C for 10 sec
				- 60C for 1 mins
				
4) Check the Type of Dyes are being measured
	-3 Dye Hydrolosis and VIC and FAM should be selected (reporter Dyes that are used in the Probes we ordered)
	
5)Under Plate Set-Up Tab
	a) Label all the wells and put both reporter dyes in each well
	b) Labeled as Unknown Targets
	
6) Select "Relative Quantification" to tell machine what to look for
	
*Results*
	Went up with Janet the next day to export the data and from the fluorescent history and it looked like absolutely nothing amplified
	
	So ran a gel on the qPCR product from the qPCR run - Also did not get any bands (5uL of qPCR product with 1uL of Loading Dye on a 1% agarose gel run at 100V for 45mins - 100kb Ladder)
		Row 1: Ladder, A1-A12 (left to right)
		Row 2: Ladder, B1-B12 (left to right)

*20191009

In light of the lack of amplification I decided to run just a PCR to see if I could get any amplifications with just a regular PCR! 

Samples Run Today: (All run in triplicate - 24 wells today used; A1-B12)

	**Sample ID**								
	B1_t=0									
	B5_t=0

	-DNA								1uL

PCR Run:

	a) Pre Incubation
			- 50C for 2 mins

Once again no bands present in gel (5uL of qPCR product with 1uL of Loading Dye on a 1% agarose gel run at 100V for 45mins - 100kb Ladder)

*20191010

Since there was no clear amplification of the PCR today (20191010) I decided to run a gel on just the DNA I have extracted and this is what I got
(5uL of qPCR product with 1uL of Loading Dye on a 1% agarose gel run at 100V for 45mins - 100kb Ladder)

![20191010_Mcap_t=0_DNA-Gel]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/20191010_Mcap_t=0_DNA-Gel.JPG "20191010_Mcap_t=0_DNA-Gel")

**Seems to be a serious gap in Nanodrop and Qubit and Gel quantifications of DNA present**

Plan of attack

	1) Requbit DNA again
	2)Run PCR with actual PCR Mastermix not TaqMan速 Genotyping Mix	
		-Will run the six samples at three different dilutions (1:1, 1:10, 1:50) to see if can get anything to work
			Maybe too much DNA present?

*20191011

Today tried running a PCR with different dilution factors with the most concentrated DNA extracted samples (B1, B5, B6, O9, O11, and O13) for t=0 time point

	Thought that this would help identify the problem with the lack of amplification
	
Dilution Factors were: 1:1, 1:10, and 1:50 for each samples
	
	So in the gel they were well 2 was B1 (1:1), well 3 was B1 (1:10), well 4 was B1 (1:50), etc.

Each Well received (15uL reactions) - I do not remember why I decided on this volume

	-TaqMan速 Genotyping Master Mix		5uL
	-SymC_For Primer (50nM)				2uL
	-SymC_Rev Primer (75nM)				2uL
	-SymD_For Primer (50nM)				2uL
	-SymD_Rev Primer (75nM)				2uL (All primers, probes, and MM made into Mastermix - multiplied each by 6.2; additional 0.2 for pipette error)

	-DNA								1uL

PCR Run:

	a) Pre Incubation
			- 50C for 2 mins
			- 95C for 10 mins
	b) PCR 
		- 40 Cycles of 
			- 95C for 10 sec
			- 60C for 1 mins
			
Once again no bands present in gel (5uL of qPCR product with 1uL of Loading Dye on a 1% agarose gel run at 100V for 45mins - 100kb Ladder)

	Also should note that when making the master mix I kept having to make more and more of it because something in my calculations was off. Basically this was a huge mess
